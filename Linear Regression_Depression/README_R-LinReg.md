**Depression_LinReg.Rmd**: this is the R notebook containing the R codes for the entire project, from data importing and cleaning to model buidling and evaluation, including visualizations.  
**data files**: this folder contains the datasets used in the project.  
**Depression_LinReg_files**: this folder contains the visualizations (graphs, tables, and other plots) rendered from R codes in the R notebook.  
**Depression_LinReg.md**: this is a simple, less sophisticated markdown version of the R notebook.
